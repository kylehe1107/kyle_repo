Goal: Analyze user growth, plan adoption, revenue trends, and churn behavior to understand Slack’s performance during the pandemic.

Consistent Growth: Slack’s monthly revenue grew from $81.0M in Jan 2020 to $124.6M in Dec 2021 – an overall increase of about 54% over 24 months. This reflects an average ~2% month-over-month revenue growth, with only minor dips (largest single-month drop was -5.7% in Feb 2020).

Revenue by Tier: Pro subscriptions consistently contributed around 75% of total revenue (≈$75M of the ~$100M monthly revenue on average), compared to ~20% from Business+ (≈$20M) and ~5% from Enterprise (≈$5M). This highlights the Pro tier as the primary revenue driver, far outpacing the higher-tier plans in revenue share.

Peak vs. Trough: The highest revenue month was Dec 2021 at $124.6M, while the lowest was Feb 2020 at $76.5M. This indicates a strong upward trajectory, with the peak monthly revenue 63% higher than the early-2020 low point, demonstrating substantial growth over the two-year period.

Rapid Growth Periods: Identified notable surges in revenue during certain months well above the average growth rate. For example, Mar 2020 saw a +10.5% jump in revenue (month-over-month) – likely reflecting a wave of new users during the early remote-work shift – and May 2021 saw a +7.6% spike. These rapid growth periods highlight moments of accelerated customer adoption in Slack’s user base.

Churn and Retention: Spotted clear churn rate trends correlating with revenue performance. Churn peaked at 6.3% in Feb 2020 (coinciding with that month’s revenue dip) but improved to 3.8% by Dec 2021 – the lowest churn in the dataset. This improved retention over time aligns with Slack’s record-high revenues, underscoring the impact of keeping churn low on sustaining growth.
